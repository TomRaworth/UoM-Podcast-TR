Description: multistream recorder and player compatible with Opencast Matterhorn 
 Galicaster is specially designed to be integrated on your lecture capture
 system. Galicaster-based devices can work as improved Matterhorn capture 
 agents. They can register as a capture agent, thus being able to receive 
 scheduled recordings and ingest the resulting mediapackages automatically.
